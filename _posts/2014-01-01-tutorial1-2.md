At this point, we have a running xnlogic application that contains only boilerplate code. We will gradually turn this application into a simplified version of Twitter.

![Data model]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/twitter_like_model.png)

Here is a high-level description of our data model:

 * The only entities/models are `User`s and `Tweet`s.
 * `User`s have `username` and `email` properties.
 * `Tweet`s have `content` and `created_at` properties.
 * A `User` can create `Tweet`s.    
   That is, there is a one-to-many relation between a user and their tweets.
 * `User`s can follow one another.    
   That is, there is a many-to-many relation between users (i.e. a user can follow many users, and can be followed by many users).
   

In the next few tutorials, we will gradually build our application according to this data model. We will then use the power of the xnlogic framework, to perform interesting queries on our data.
